A website for keeping track of all you home goods

To use, you need a server wether that is local or global to be able to run all of the databases. Once you have a server you will have to run the provided SQL scripts to create your database and tables that will be required to use the page. You will also need to change some of the php code that connects to the database depending on which server type you use. If a local server is used, no change is necesarry. If a global server is used, the database host will need to be changed in the code.

To use the website you will first need to go to the login page where you can create an account if you are a first time user or login if you already have an existing account. 

Once you have logged in, the website will redirect you to the home page where it also has some instructions. From there you can go to the items page to see the items you have already added or add new ones. To add a new item, use the form near the bottom of the page and fill out all fields. To edit an item, click the item button next to it and it will redirect you to a page with a form to edit the item. To delete an item, simply press the delete button next to the item.

Thank you for using my website!
